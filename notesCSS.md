# notes

## Sometimes anchor tag not landing in the coreect place, the best way to solve is that add another class, display as blcok, 
## then adjust padding-top and margin-top with same number, but padding go positive, and margin go negative

## Since ul and li elements are display: block by default â€” give them auto margins and a width that is smaller than their container.
### ul {
    width: 70%;
    margin: auto;
### }
